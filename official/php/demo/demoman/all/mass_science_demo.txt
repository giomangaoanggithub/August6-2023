Thermal Equilibrium When the two bodies in contact are at the 
same temperature and there is no flow of heat between them, these 
are said to be in thermal equilibrium. The common temperature of 
the bodies in thermal equilibrium is called the equilibrium 
temperature.
Thermal Expansion The increase in the size of an object on heating 
is called thermal expansion.
Thermometer It is a device used for numerical measurement of 
temperature. The commonly used thermometer is mercury 
thermometer.
Third law of motion Whenever two objects interact, the force 
exerted on one object is equal in size and opposite in direction to 
the force exerted on the other object; forces always occur in 
matched pairs that are equal and opposite
Time Period (of a wave) The time taken by a wave to travel through 
a distance equal to its wavelength is called its time period. It is 
denoted by T. Time period of a wave=1/frequency of the wave.
Time Period (of an oscillation) The time taken to complete one
oscillation is called the time period of an oscillation. The time period 
of a pendulum does not depend upon the mass of the bob and 
amplitude of oscillation. The time period of a pendulum is directly 
proportional to the square root of the length and inversely 
proportional to the square root of the acceleration due to gravity.
Total internal reflection Condition where all light is reflected back 
from a boundary between materials; occurs when light arrives at a 
boundary at the critical angle or beyond
Transverse waves A wave in which the particles of the medium 
oscillate in a direction perpendicular of the direction of propagation 
of wave is called the transverse wave. Water waves, light waves 
and radio waves are examples of transverse waves.
Trough The point of maximum negative displacement on a 
transverse wave is called a trough.
Ultrasonic Sound waves too high in frequency to be heard by the 
human ear; frequencies above 20,000Hz
Unbalanced forces When a number of forces act on a body and the 
resultant force is not zero, then the forces are said to be
unbalanced.
Uniform Acceleration When the velocity of a body increases by 
equal amounts in equal intervals of time it is said to have uniform 
acceleration.
Uniform Circular Motion The motion of an object in a circular path 
with uniform speed is called uniform circular motion. Uniform
circular motion is accelerated motion.
Uniform Speed When a body travels equal distances in equal 
intervals of time then it is said to have uniform speed.
Uniform Velocity When a body travels along a straight line in 
particular direction and covers equal distances in equal intervals of 
time it is said to have uniform velocity.
Universal law of gravitation Every object in the universe is attracted 
to every other object with a force directly proportional to the product 
of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the 
distance between the centers of the two masses
Unpolarized light Light consisting of transverse waves vibrating in 
all conceivable random directions
Van der Wall's force General term for weak attractive intermolecular 
forces
Vapor The gaseous state of a substance that is normally in the 
liquid state
Vector Quantity A quantity, which needs both magnitude and
direction to describe it, is called a vector quantity. Such a physical 
quantity should also follow the vector law of addition.
Velocity Distance traveled by a body in a particular direction per 
unit time is called its velocity. It can also be defined as the 
displacement of the body per unit time. It is a vector quantity. The 
SI units of velocity are m / s.
Vibration A back and forth motion that repeats itself
Virtual image An image where light rays appear to originate from a 
mirror or lens; this image cannot be projected on a screen
Volt Unit of potential difference equivalent to joules/coulomb
Voltage drop The electric potential difference across a resistor or 
other part of a circuit that consumes power
Watt Metric unit for power; equivalent to joule/sec
Wave mechanics Alternate name for quantum mechanics derived 
from the wavelike properties of subatomic particles
Wave motion The movement of a disturbance produced in one part 
of a medium to another involving the transfer of energy but not the 
transfer of matter is called wave motion.
Wave period The time required for two successive crests or other 
successive parts of the wave to pass a given point
Wave velocity The distance traveled by a wave in one second is 
called the wave velocity. The wave velocity of a wave depends 
upon the nature of the medium through which it passes.
Wave (mechanical) A periodic disturbance produced in a material 
medium due to the vibratory motion of the particles of the medium 
is called a wave.
Wave A disturbance or oscillation that moves through a medium
Wavelength The distance between the two nearest points on a
wave, which are in the same phase, is called the wavelength of the 
wave. The distance between two adjacent crests or two adjacent 
troughs is called its wavelength.
Weight The force with which a body is attracted towards the center 
of the earth is called its weight. The SI unit of weight is N. The
gravitational units of weight are kg-wt and g-wt. The weight of a 
body of mass m is given by mg. Its value will depend upon the 
value of g at that place. The weight of a body is measured with a
spring balance.
Weightlessness The state when the apparent weight of a body 
becomes zero is called the state of weightlessness. All objects 
while falling freely under the action of gravity appear weightless.
Work = Force x Displacement in the direction of the force
Work Work is done when a force acting on a body displaces it. 
Work is a scalar quantity. The SI unit for work is Joule.
